    <p>By using Compani™, you agree to the following completely enforceable (and totally reasonable) terms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You acknowledge that Compani™ is not responsible for sudden bouts of joy, spontaneous laughter, or cravings for table tennis.</li>
      <li>If you challenge Seth to a duel of delight, you must provide snacks.</li>
      <li>Any disputes will be resolved via Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch, best of 3 races.</li>
      <li>Luke reserves the right to make moderately perverted jokes during meetings. Acceptance of this condition is mandatory.</li>
      <li>Hannah may yell in your general direction at any time. This is a feature, not a bug.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By continuing to browse this website, you certify that you are cool with all of the above. If you’re not, we suggest adopting a cat, and then trying again.</p>
