    <p>At Compani™, we take your privacy as seriously as we take our collection of antique rubber ducks — which is to say, very seriously, but with occasional squeaks.</p>
    <p>By submitting your email, you consent to us storing it in a secure vault guarded by two cats, a philosophical debate club, and occasionally Gianluca’s Nintendo Switch.</p>
    <p>We may use your data to:  
      <ul>
        <li>Send you disruptive insights.</li>
        <li>Remind you to drink water.</li>
        <li>Generate AI haikus about companionship.</li>
        <li>Compete with your fridge for attention.</li>
